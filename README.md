# Alethia

Alethia is blockchain-enabled certification verification service. The name "Alethia" stems from the Greek spirit of truth, something that this project values. The intent of this application is to allow alumni to upload their certificates and along with a signature ID provided by their school's dean in order to allow other users of Alethia to vote for their certificate to make it valid. 

## Getting Started
