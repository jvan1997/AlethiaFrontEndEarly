## Alethia
Alethia is a platform for blockchain enabled certificates using Ethereum's Rikeby Testnet and Ganache-CLI for testing smart contracts. Link to the source code: https://github.com/jvan1997/alethia-certificates.github.io

## Setup 
1. `git clone https://github.com/jvan1997/alethia-certificates.github.io.git`
2. `cd alethia-certificates.github.io/src`
3. `npm install --save`
4. Download Metamask for your browser, and deposit some test tokens. (Link to download: https://metamask.io/)
5. To deposit test tokens, request some from a test faucet (Instructions: https://medium.com/hellogold/adding-tokens-to-metamask-60b2fedd5bd9)
6. In your terminal type `testrpc` in one window and run the application on a different window. (Link to download: https://truffleframework.com/docs/ganache/quickstart)

## Running the application

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**
